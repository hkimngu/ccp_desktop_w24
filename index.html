            <p>I actually don't have any pets, I'm like mediocore at best with cooking, and I'm too afraid of TSA to really go travel but I'll try my best :'&#41;</p>

                Not gonna lie, almost everything I write here is likely a like. I actually don't have any pets. So basically
                eveything in the Pet page is a lie. I also lied about the places in the Travel section. I don't travel and I haven't
                been to any of the places except Detroit.
            </p>
            <p>
                The recipes are true though. Especially about the Peasant Meal. I'm not the best chef but I tried.
